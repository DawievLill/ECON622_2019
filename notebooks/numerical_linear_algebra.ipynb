    "### Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "As the goal of this section is to move towards numerical linear algebra of large systems, we need to understand how well algorithms scale with size.  This notion is called [computational complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity).\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notion of complexity can work at various levels such as the number of [significant digits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations#Arithmetic_functions) for basic mathematical operations, the amount of memory and storage required, or the amount of time) - but we will typically focus on the time-complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For time-complexity, the `N` is usually the dimensionality of the problem, although occasionally the key will be the number of non-zeros in the matrix or width of bands.  For our applications, time-complexity is best thought of as the number of floating point operations (e.g. add, multiply, etc.) required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity of algorithms is typically written in [Big O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation) notation which provides bounds on the scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we can write this as $ f(N) = O(g(N)) \\text{ as} N \\to \\infty $ wher the interpretation is that there exists some constants $ M, N_0 $ such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(N) \\leq M g(N), \\text{ for } N > N_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the complexity of finding an LU Decomposition of a dense matrix is $ O(N^3) $ which should be read as there being a constant where\n",
    "eventually the number of floating point operations required decompose a matrix of size $ N\\times N $ grows cubically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that these are asymptotic results intended to understanding the scaling of the problem, and the constant can matter for a given\n",
    "fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the number of operations required for an [LU decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition#Algorithms) of a dense $ N \\times N $ matrix $ 2/3 N^3 $, ignoring the $ N^2 $ and lower terms.  However, sparse matrix algorithms instead scale with the number of non-zeros in the matrix instead."

    "### Rules of Computational Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining algorithms, you will sometimes need to think through how [combining algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Properties) changes complexity.  For example, if you do,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. an $ O(N^3) $ operation $ P $ times, then it simply changes the constant and remains $ O(N^3) $  \n",
    "1. one $ O(N^3) $ operation and another $ O(N^2) $ one, then you take the max, which does not change the scale $ O(N^3) $  \n",
    "1. a repetition of a $ O(N) $ operation that itself uses an $ O(N) $ one, you take the product, and the complexity becomes $ O(N^2) $  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, there is a word of caution: dense matrix-multiplication is an [expensive operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_of_mathematical_operations#Matrix_algebra) for unstructured matrices, and the basic version is $ O(N^3) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, modern libraries use highly turned and [careful algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication_algorithm) to multiply matrices and exploit the computer architecture, memory cache, etc., but this simply lowers the constant of proportionality and they remain $ O(N^3) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence is that, since many algorithms require matrix-matrix multiplication, it means that it is usually not possible to go below that order without further matrix structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, changing the constant of proportionality for a given size can help, but in order to achieve higher scaling you need to identify matrix structure and ensure your operations do not lose it."
